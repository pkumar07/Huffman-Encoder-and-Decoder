# Huffman-Encoder-and-Decoder

The application performs Huffman Encoding and Decoding for large amount of data.
Prior to the developement of the Huffman Encoder and Decoder, the performance of different priority queues like Binary Heap, pairing heaps and 4-way cache optimized heap was evaluted.
Performance of 4-way cache optimized heap was found to be the best. Hence, further implementations is using this data structure.

Running the files:
$ make
$ java encoder <input_file_name>
$ java decoder <encoded_file_name> <code_table_file_name>
